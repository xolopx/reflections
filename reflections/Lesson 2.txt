What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Use command "git init" in the directory with the project. This will not create any commits by default but will allow you to do so in the future.
That means that the files after repository creation are untracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It holds the files you want to commit together. It allows the user to customize what they want to commit together, for exmaple if a file is logically related to
another they can be committed together.adasd
